# Zork-2
## Description
### What?
Zork is a game published in 1980, which was based around line by line commands which the user could type into a prompt and the events which they caused. It was an adventure game, so each prompt would change something about the current 'world' the player is exploring. It can be thought of as Dungeons and Dragons in the form of a single-player, simple video game.

With this project, we hope to create something similar to zork; an adventure game where the user of the program can enter a command, resulting events and changes to the world. A basic story will be created, and the user will be able to traverse through the world, taking actions that will help them achieve their goals.
### Why?
This program will allow us to apply everything which we have learned so far in a particularly fun and interesting fashion.
### How? 
We will make a base and go from there; it will be relatively simple, but we can always add more complex mechanics.

There will be a base code which will hold the main components of the game, all in one place; however, for each command and event separate classes will be made, along with the user interface and whatever else may be needed to create the game. That way, everything will be easily differentiable, creating simple code for a mildly complex project.
## Deliverables
1. Full code for a functional game.
2. Proper documentation of the code.
3. A manual, which will explain the mechanics of the game and how it should be played.
